# Book-Store-Application

This project is based on Book Store Application which works on Java- Graphic User Interface.
Project Details are:
- This Application is based on asking basic details of the customer who are wish to buy a book.
- This project has been designed in two ways: Customer and Owner Screens.
- Owner Screen gives the basic content about the information of the Books.
- Customer Screen gives the basic details of the Customer and their status of membership followed by the book name and its price.

**We have presented this by using the UML Diagram.**
A use case description represents a class of functionality or behaviour provided by the system as seen from an actor’s point of view. The bookstore app has three use cases which are login, buy books and logout. The use-case has seven descriptions which are used to describe the event flow between the actor and system. The first is the name of the use case. The second is the participating actors which lists the actors interacting with the system. The third is the entry conditions which are conditions that need to be satisfied before the use case is initiated. The fourth is the flow of events which are numbered sequences of interactions of the use case. The fifth is the exit conditions that need to be satisfied before the use case is initiated. The sixth is the exceptions which describes what happens if things go wrong. Lastly, special requests which are not related to the functionality of the system. Below are three tables explaining the three use cases for the Bookstore application.

**Implementation of Code & Class Diagram**
The code was implemented using JavaFX on Netbeans. JavaFX is a new platform for creating graphical user interface (GUI) applications. This enables applications to run in both a desktop and a web browser environment. Every program created in this project is in a class that extends from javafx.application.Application. 
 
JavaFX may be a Java library utilized to construct Wealthy Web Applications. The applications composed utilizing this library can run reliably over numerous stages. JavaFX may be a program stage for making and conveying desktop applications, as well as 	Wealthy Web Applications (RIA’s) that can run over a wide assortment of gadgets. Java FX has bolster for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft Windows, Linux and macOS, as well as portable gadgets running iOS and Android.

The best feature for JavaFX offers smooth graphics that render quickly through Prism when it is used with a supported graphics card or graphics processing unit(GPU). If a system does not feature one of the recommended GPUs supported by JavaFX, then Prism defaults to the Java 2D software stack. High-performance media engine. 
→ Import javafx.Scene.scene; A scene represents the physical contents of a JavaFX application. The class Scene of the package javafx. Scene represents the scene object. At an instance, the scene object is added to only one stage. 
→ Import javafx.util.ArrayList; ArrayList inherits AbstractList class and implements List Interface. ArrayList is initialized by the size. Java ArrayList allows us to randomly access the list. 
→ import javafx.collections.ObservableList; A list that enables listeners to track changes when they occur.
→ import javafx.collections.FXCollections; A utility class that consists of static methods that are one-to-one
